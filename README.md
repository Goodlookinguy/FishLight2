Arduino Fish Light 2 personal project for friend. This is a replacement for the first project which was too grand and crashes the Arduino for unknown reasons, but the current guess is possibly too much memory allocation. The other is not allocating an object and using it, but looking through the code a dozen times and nothing like that shows up.

This is for studying of code if nothing else. Without schematics, it's worthless to anyone but me.
