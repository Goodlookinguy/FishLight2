Arduino Fish Light 2 personal project for friend. Some of his code is left in there and is commented out until I feel like removing it later. It's noticeably different from my code, in that they had to comment every line. I rarely comment code unless neccessary.

This is a replacement for the first project which was too grand and crashes the Arduino for unknown reasons, but the current guess is possibly too much memory allocation. The other is not allocating an object and using it, but looking through the code a dozen times and nothing like that shows up.

This is for studying of code if nothing else. Without schematics, it's worthless to anyone but me.
